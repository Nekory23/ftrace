# ftrace
{EPITECH} | Second year | Unix Programming - Instrumentation

As you know, ftrace allows to list all of the different inputs and outputs of a program’s function.
Therefore, you must list the following:
 - system calls,
 - a program’s internal function calls with their name and address,
 - signals received from other programs,
 - function calls contained in the shared libraries (.so).

See the subject for further details !
